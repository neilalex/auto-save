Synopsis
-------
In the occasion where you'd want Sublime Text to save the current file after
each keystroke, you can use this plugin. It was created because
I wanted to make a screencast that shows live editing of HTML/CSS along side
by side with the changes in the browser. It's easy to use Javascript to
reload the browers every second, but I did not want to manually save the
file after every keystroke.

Demo
-------
Here is a [screencast](http://jzhang.io/auto-save) of me editing HTML and CSS
with the plugin.

Installation
-------
#### From Package Control
AutoSave is available through [Sublime Package Control](https://sublime.wbond.net/)
and is the recommended way to install.

#### From Github
Alternatively, you may install via GitHub by cloning this repository into the `Packages`
directory under Sublime Text's data directory:

On Mac:

```
cd ~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages
git clone https://github.com/jamesfzhang/auto-save.git
```

Usage
-------
By default, AutoSave is disabled because it is a fairly invasive plugin.
To enable it, you must first bind the command to turn the plugin
on or off. Open "Preferences / Key Bindings - User" and add:

```js
{ "keys": ["ctrl+shift+s"], "command": "auto_save" }
```

With this setting, pressing <kbd>Ctrl + Shift + S</kbd> will turn the plugin
on or off. A status message will be displayed in the Sublime Status Bar each
time the plugin is turned on or off.
